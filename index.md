# Introduction
The Shape of Roman History project explores the history of Roman Republic through an analysis of the most up-to-date database of ancient persons available [http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/](url). Through the existing rdf database, we were able to make new connections and gain a deeper insight into Roman life. The data visualizations in this project were created with D3 and Unity3D. This project is affiliated with the UCLA RomeLab [romelab.etc.ucla.edu](url).
