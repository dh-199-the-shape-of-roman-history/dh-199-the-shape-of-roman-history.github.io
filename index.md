# Introduction
The Shape of Roman History project explores the history of Roman Republic through an analysis of the most up-to-date database of ancient persons available [http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/](http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/). Through the existing rdf database, we were able to make new connections and gain a deeper insight into Roman life. The data visualizations in this project were created with D3. Google Charts, and Unity3D. This project is affiliated with UCLA RomeLab [http://hvwc.etc.ucla.edu/](http://hvwc.etc.ucla.edu/).

# DPRR RDF Repository - Query

Using the Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic's RDF Repository, the queries were manually inputted and returned with the specific data. Here is an example of a query used to find all the documented Romans with the title of Triumphator: <br>

## The Roman Funeral
The Roman Funeral offered families an opportunity to highlight the achievements of their deceased ancestors.  Many funerals culminated in a speech on the Rostra, the primary speaking platform in the Forum, with actors hired to wear garments associated with the highest political position each ancestor in the family obtained.

## Visualizations by Political Office
Many political offices existed in Rome.  Some, like consul, were held by the same number of people per year (2), while others, like dictator, were appointed in times of crisis only.  These visualizations can be used to, among other things, show gaps in the database.
### Triumphators
